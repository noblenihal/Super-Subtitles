## Super-Subtitles

Chrome Extension to learn English through Subtitles while watching YouTube

## How does it helps 

Non-native English speakers often tend to look for meaning of difficult words. Learning while watching YouTube is a great way to learn a language. You will definitely need a dictionary in hand to understand the true meaning of the sentences.

Wouldn't it be great if you could get the meaning of the words in the YouTube Video Player itself? Well thats pretty much what this extension does for you.
